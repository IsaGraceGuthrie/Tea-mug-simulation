# Tea-mug-simulation
This code simulates how long it takes to drink an ounce of tea. I described the color, shape, and size/amount that the tea mug holds, using class. Then I created a function that takes an amount of time, and then subtracts .5 *minutes from the class, and ends up with how much tea is left in the mug after the specified number of minutes.
